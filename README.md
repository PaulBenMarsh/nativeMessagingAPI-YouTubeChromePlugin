# nativeMessagingAPI-YouTubeChromePlugin

<h1>Overview</h1>
This project is based off of my native messaging API project <a href="https://github.com/PaulBenMarsh/nativeMessagingAPI-QTNative">"QTNative"</a>.
It is meant to be an application that acts as a queue for downloading YouTube videos via a Google Chrome extension.
This project is currently not in working condition.
